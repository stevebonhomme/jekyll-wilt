Welcome to my site! I am excited to have you as my guest! Let me introduce myself.

My name is Steve Bonhonmme and I am a full stack developer with over 10 years experience. Spend most of my time designing, building and administering dynamic websites. Fluent in multiple programming languages including Python, PHP, JavaScript, Java and C#.

We never stop learning and this site is a testiment of that. This site is supposed to be my programming, learning diary.

I actively partake in programming courses on [Coursera](http://coursera.org), [EDX](http://edx.org), [RealPython](http://realpython.com), [Code Academy](http://codecademy.com), [freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org) etc. Whatever I learn I will share with everyone on this site.  I am open to suggestions, comments, and collaboration so please feel free to contact me any time!

This site is powered by Jekyll, a popular, powerful site generator. 

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
