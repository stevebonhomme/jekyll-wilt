# What I Learned Today

This repository is for my git and Jekyll powered site [wilt](https://wilt.dev).This is a live, full production example of a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that can be deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com). You can easily deploy one of your own. If you need assistance to deploy and administer such a site please feel free to contact me.

## About

My name is Steve Bonhonmme and I am a full stack developer with over 10 years experience. Spend most of my time designing, building and administering dynamic websites. Fluent in multiple programming languages including Python, PHP, JavaScript, Java and C#.

We never stop learning and this repository powers my site wilt.dev which is a testiment of that. Wilt, short for "what I learned today", is my programming, learning diary.

I actively partake in programming courses on [Coursera](http://coursera.org), [EDX](http://edx.org), [RealPython](http://realpython.com), [Code Academy](http://codecademy.com), [freeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org) etc. Whatever I learn I will share with everyone on this site.  I am open to suggestions, comments, and collaboration so please feel free to contact me any time!
